# credentials-auth-wallet

A simple CLI application, which allows you to generate an Ethereum wallet from traditional credentials (username and password) without storing anything anywhere. PoC (see: first commit) was developed in 15 minutes or so, I made some changes afterwards.

## How to use
I am assuming you already have `yarn`, but you may use `npm` if you want.
- clone the project using `git` and enter its directory
- install dependencies using `yarn install`
- use `yarn start` to start the cli interface
- proceed with given instructions

## Credits
download13 for [Blockies library](https://github.com/download13/blockies), I recycled a lot of its code in BloCLIes
