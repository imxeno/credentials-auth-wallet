# credentials-auth-wallet

A simple CLI application serving as a PoC, which allows you to generate an Ethereum wallet from traditional credentials (username and password) without storing anything anywhere.

## How to use
I am assuming you already have `yarn`, but you may use `npm` if you want.
- clone the project using `git` and enter its directory
- install dependencies using `yarn install`
- use `yarn start` to start the cli interface
- enter desired username and password
- procedurally generated private key and wallet address will be displayed
